# Witcher Responses Bot

A reddit bot that can reply to comments in /r/Gwent & /r/Witcher subreddits with a link to the actual voice line. Inspired by [Jonarzz's DotaResponsesBot](https://github.com/Jonarzz/DotaResponsesRedditBot)

![Formatted Example](http://i.imgur.com/qCNHFNg.png)

The bot will only reply to comments that are meant for a reply from this bot. There is also margin for error like not having the correct punctuation

If there is multiple responses with the same content, the bot will try to use the one related to the users flair.
